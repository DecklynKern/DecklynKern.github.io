            Fractal rendering part 2: Plenty of math
        </h1>
        <p>
            In this part I am going to explain some more of the math behind the Mandelbrot fractal we made last time. This can be skipped if this isn't necessarily your thing but I think understanding the theory can help aid the programming and exploring processes a lot. This section might get added to in the future if I decide there is anything else I should explain.

            Motivation for Mandelbrot fractal images
        </h2>
        <p>
            The idea behind rendering Mandelbrot fractals is the Mandelbrot set, the distinction of which I will explain. The Mandelbrot set is actually the black region in the renders you have seen so far. It is defined as the set of all points <code>c</code> in the complex plane for which the update <code>z ← z<sup>2</sup> + c (z<sub>0</sub> = 0)</code> stays bounded and never escapes to infinity. All the colouring is actually just fanciness added on for looks (although it can have its own properties).

        <p>
            To get comfortable with this I will show some examples along the real line:
            For <code>c = -2</code> we have:
        </p>
        <code>
            z<sub>0</sub> = 0<br>
            z<sub>1</sub> = z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - 2 = -2<br>
            z<sub>2</sub> = z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - 2 = 2<br>
            z<sub>3</sub> = z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - 2 = 2
        </code>
        <p>
            And it is pretty easy to see that this sequence has converged on the number 2 and will stay there as many times as we iterate. Therefore -2 is in the Mandelbrot set. Next let's try <code>c = -1</code>:
        </p>
        <code>
            z<sub>0</sub> = 0<br>
            z<sub>1</sub> = z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1 = -1<br>
            z<sub>2</sub> = z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1 = 0<br>
            z<sub>3</sub> = z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - 1 = -1
        </code>
        <p>
            This is also caught in an obvious cycle between -1 and 0 and therefore -1 is also part of the Mandelbrot set. Now for an example of a blowup to infinity, try <code>c = 1</code>:
        </p>
        <code class="math">
            z<sub>0</sub> = 0</code><br>
            z<sub>1</sub> = z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + 1 = 1<br>
            z<sub>2</sub> = z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2<br>
            z<sub>3</sub> = z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + 1 = 5<br>
            z<sub>4</sub> = z<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> + 1 = 26
        </code>
        <p>
            It should be clear this is never coming near 0 again, therefore 1 is not in the Mandelbrot set. In fact it is provable that the intersection of the Mandelbrot set and the real number line is the interval <code>[-2, 0.25]</code> Obviously when we start talking about complex numbers the situation gets more... complex due to the 2-dimensional nature of how these numbers jump around when iterating and hence why the resulting shape has fascinated millions.

            Why stop when <code>|z| > 2</code>?
        </h2>
        <p>
            For performance reasons, it is normal to stop iterating once a point reaches an absolute value greater than two, but what is the justification for doing this? There are probably many ways to prove this, but this is how I intuitively see this. We will assume <code>|c| ≤ 2</code>, which is true for all <code>c</code> in the Mandelbrot set. Since we are looking at what happens when <code>|z| > 2</code> we have <code>|z| > 2 ≥ |c|</code>. Lets look at the absolute value of the update formula.
        </p>
        <p>
            First we use the absolute value rule <code>|a - b| ≥ ||a| - |b||</code>:
        </p>
        <code>|z<sup>2</sup> + c| ≥ ||z<sup>2</sup>| - |c|| = ||z|<sup>2</sup> - |c||</code><br>
        <code>|z<sup>2</sup> + c| > ||z|<sup>2</sup> - |z||</code><br>
        <p>
            Now we will use the fact that for any <code>n > 2, n<sup>2</sup> > 2n</code>.
        </p>
        <code>|z<sup>2</sup> + c| > |z|</code>
        <p>
            And just like that we have proved the sequence only gets larger past this point. Now this is not true in general for escape-time fractals, and some do not even have a perfect escape radius to stop at. So it is usually a good idea to have an input to mess around with that as well.
        </p>
        <h2>
            The fractal looks symmetrical, is it?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Yes, it fairly trivial to show using complex conjugate (<code class="overline">a + bi</code><code> = a - bi</code>) rules that <code class="overline">z<sup>2</sup> + c</code> = <code>(</code><code class="overline">z</code>)<sup>2</sup><code> + </code><code class="overline">c</code>. Therefore the sequence of iterations for a point with a positive imaginary value is mirrored for the equivalent point on the other side of the real line and vice-versa.
            For example, take the c = i:
        </p>
        <code>
            z<sub>0</sub> = 0</code><br>
            z<sub>1</sub> = z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + i = i<br>
            z<sub>2</sub> = z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + i = -1 + i<br>
            z<sub>3</sub> = z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + i = -i<br>
            z<sub>4</sub> = z<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> + i = -1 + i
        </code>
        <p>
            and c = -i
        </p>
        <code>
            z<sub>0</sub> = 0<br>
            z<sub>1</sub> = z<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> - i = -i<br>
            z<sub>2</sub> = z<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - i = -1 - i<br>
            z<sub>3</sub> = z<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> - i = i<br>
            z<sub>4</sub> = z<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> - i = -1 - i
        </code>
        <p>
            We can see that the paths are equivalent, just with negated imaginary values from each other.
