                    Hi,
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am Decklyn Kern. I'm a programmer from Alberta, Canada who loves Jesus, programming, and games. Computers are a huge part of my life, I am often working on (usually unfinished) hobby projects on the side from my job as a software developer. Many of these projects are catalogued here or on my GitHub page. I have been programming since I was 13 years old and am a strong believer in the power of code for both the creative and practical.
